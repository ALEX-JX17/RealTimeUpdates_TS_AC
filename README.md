This is a Real-time updates proyect with Turbo Streams and Action Cable example. to test how to use them on Rails 7.

With this I want to test the client side real time updates without use any javascript framework like react, node or any other.




Some other implemented features to become a better coder are:
    
    *System tests
    *slim
    *simple form
